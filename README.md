## About

This app is a modern way to embed an eco-friendly lifestyle into people to take care of our environment. A lot of the time, we need motivation to do whatâ€™s right and so we developed an app that improves our human lifestyle by being rewarded with every eco-friendly action we take. There are very small but impactful ways to save the plant like, using reusable bags, shopping at thrift stores, or taking bus/carpooling and each time someone does so this app will reward them! Simply scanning a QR code at every location where you can be environmentally friendly will enable you to claim points that can be converted into discounts, coupons or gift cards to small businesses!

Download the Expo app or open your phone camera/google lens and try it out! Note: Not a full functioning app, just a prototype demo :)

Project is created with:
* React.js
* Python
* APIs ()

	


## Next Steps
In the future, we'd like to:
* Add a location feature to send users text-based reminders to the user, informing them that an Ecode is nearby. We can use the Geolocation Google Maps API and Twilio API to implement this. 
* Add a carpooling feature which enables users to earn points together by carpooling with one another!!
